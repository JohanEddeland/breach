# Release 1.2.1

## Users
- GUI: set input now updates main GUI when done
- InitNNDemo in simple ML model example
- GUI allows multiple cell edition with shift-return
- GUI: set input does not reset signal generators

## Bugfixes
- GUI copy select button works again

## Developpers

# Release 1.2.0

## Users
- New PlotDomain method
- domains can be set with the syntax SetDomain([4 5.1]), will infer double type
- error is returned when wrong type is given in SetDomain
- default behavior of legacy sampling functions is to reset and replace, this is changed by AppendWhenSample flag
- new warning when breach can't get checksum of model from Simulink. Only affects the Log to file features.
- GetBoundedDomains returns domains with bounds/ranges
- GUI work with all BreachSet in the workspace, regardles of system interfaced
- AddSpec now add property parameters automatically
- PlotParams, PlotSignals, etc, now re-use the current figure if there is one (gcf)

## Bugs fixed
- compilation issue with VS 2015 for online monitoring (added include minmax and algorithm) 
- from_file_signal_gen not working for files in current folder 
- AppendWhenSample now works with legacy sampling functions, i.e., concat new param vectors when true 
- Parallel with less initial parameters than freq_update now works as intended
- AddSpec now checks whether formula is already present (prevent overwrite param values)

## Developpers  
- SampleDomain now calls sample method of BreachDomain
- BreachSet now has only one field Domains for signal and parameter domains 
- SetParamRanges errors when param does not exist (before would create it)
- ResetParamSet uses Domains instead of ParamRanges field
- SetParamSpec has an additional argument to ignore if param is a system parameter, if not set, return an error
- got rid of ParamRanges field, useless since we use domains

# Release 1.1.0

## Users 
- New menu in Simulink editor, can generate a Breach interface
- Breach now supports/detects To Workspace blocks
- Breach now supports/detects signal builders
- GUI for specs now can change parameters of formulas
- New GUI for creating input generator, accessible from main GUI 
- Main GUI keyboard shortcuts
- rightarrow from constant parameters to varying parameters, equivalent to [add =>]
- leftarrow from varying parameters equivalent to button [<= rem]
- return from varying parameters focus on min value
- log to files via SetupLogFolder 
- Support for different types via Domains
- SampleDomain, more comprehensive sampling of domains

## BugFix
- Fixed problem when resetting input generator with models with no inputs
- Fixed problem when logging multi dimensional signals
- Fixed problem with empty tspan when interfacing model
- Fixed problem Simulink models with no inputs


# Release 1.0.0

## Users

- BrDemo subfolder Optim contains InitAFC_Falsif which creates falsification problems
- BrDemo has a subfolder InputGen containing demo script for each type of generator (under construction)
- New method FilterSpec return sets that satisfy and don't satisfy a spec  
- SetParamRanges accepts a single interval for multiple parameters, 
    Example:
B.SetParamRanges({'p1', 'p2','p3'}, [ -1 , 1] ) is equivalent to
B.SetParamRanges({'p1', 'p2','p3'}, [ -1 , 1 ; -1 1 ;-1 1] ) 

- BreachSimulinkSystem now has a field sim_args used to pass additional option arguments to the Simulink sim command
- BreachSystem has SetSpec method - same as AddSpec, but reset Specs before
- BreachOpenSystem (hence BreachSimulinkSystem) has a AddInputSpec and SetInputSpec, calls AddSpec or SetSpec its InputGenerator
- PrintSignals now says which signal is an input 
- GetInputSignalsIdx returns indices of input signals in the list of signals of a system
- Minor improvement on display status for BreachProblem
- Input specs now are taken into account in Falsification problems
- Breach now stores its model copy and GUI files in a unique folder in Ext/ModelsData
