* Release 1.1.0
** Users 
- New menu in Simulink editor, can generate a Breach interface
- Breach now supports/detects To Workspace blocks
- Breach now supports/detects signal builders
- GUI for specs now can change parameters of formulas

- New GUI for creating input generator, accessible from main GUI 
- Main GUI keyboard shortcuts
 - rightarrow from constant parameters to varying parameters,
   equivalent to [add =>] 
 - leftarrow from varying parameters equivalent to button [<= rem]
 - return from varying parameters focus on min value
- log to files via SetupLogFolder 
- Support for different types via Domains
- SampleDomain, more comprehensive sampling of domains

** BugFix
- Fixed problem when resetting input generator with models with no inputs
- Fixed problem when logging multi dimensional signals
    
- Fixed problem with empty tspan when interfacing model
- Fixed problem Simulink models with no inputs
** Devs
- FindParam returns type in addition to indexes, 0 not found, 1 , 2 param, 3 prop
- file logging - new toolbox in Ext DataHash


* Release 1.0.0
** For users 
Changes affecting the API, behavior of functions, new features, etc.
- BrDemo subfolder Optim contains InitAFC_Falsif which creates falsification problems
- BrDemo has a subfolder InputGen containing demo script for each type of generator (under construction)
- New method FilterSpec return sets that satisfy and don't satisfy a spec  
- SetParamRanges accepts a single interval for multiple parameters, 
    Example:

B.SetParamRanges({'p1', 'p2','p3'}, [ -1 , 1] ) is equivalent to 
B.SetParamRanges({'p1', 'p2','p3'}, [ -1 , 1 ; -1 1 ;-1 1] ) 
- BreachSimulinkSystem now has a field sim_args used to pass additional option arguments to the Simulink sim command

- BreachSystem has SetSpec method - same as AddSpec, but reset Specs before
- BreachOpenSystem (hence BreachSimulinkSystem) has a AddInputSpec and SetInputSpec, calls AddSpec or SetSpec its InputGenerator
- PrintSignals now says which signal is an input 
- GetInputSignalsIdx returns indices of input signals in the list of signals of a system
- Minor improvement on display status for BreachProblem 
- Input specs now are taken into account in Falsification problems
- Breach now stores its model copy and GUI files in a unique folder in Ext/ModelsData
todo next: 
- Simulink compilation files are still generated in current folder by default, see if we can change this 
- Maybe create subfolders for each model 
- Investigate Simulink projects

** Bug fixes
- basic solver had undefined variable nb_samples  
- AddSpec when spec is given as a string now works
- CheckSpec without argument now working, though only checking the first spec in map Specs
