* Release 1.1.0

** Users 
- New menu in Simulink editor, can generate a Breach interface
- Breach now supports/detects To Workspace blocks
- Breach now supports/detects signal builders
- GUI for specs now can change parameters of formulas
- New GUI for creating input generator, accessible from main GUI 
- Main GUI keyboard shortcuts
- rightarrow from constant parameters to varying parameters, equivalent to [add =>]
- leftarrow from varying parameters equivalent to button [<= rem]
- return from varying parameters focus on min value
- log to files via SetupLogFolder 
- Support for different types via Domains
- SampleDomain, more comprehensive sampling of domains

** BugFix
- Fixed problem when resetting input generator with models with no inputs
- Fixed problem when logging multi dimensional signals
- Fixed problem with empty tspan when interfacing model
- Fixed problem Simulink models with no inputs


* Release 1.0.0

** Users

- BrDemo subfolder Optim contains InitAFC_Falsif which creates falsification problems
- BrDemo has a subfolder InputGen containing demo script for each type of generator (under construction)
- New method FilterSpec return sets that satisfy and don't satisfy a spec  
- SetParamRanges accepts a single interval for multiple parameters, 
    Example:
B.SetParamRanges({'p1', 'p2','p3'}, [ -1 , 1] ) is equivalent to
B.SetParamRanges({'p1', 'p2','p3'}, [ -1 , 1 ; -1 1 ;-1 1] ) 

- BreachSimulinkSystem now has a field sim_args used to pass additional option arguments to the Simulink sim command
- BreachSystem has SetSpec method - same as AddSpec, but reset Specs before
- BreachOpenSystem (hence BreachSimulinkSystem) has a AddInputSpec and SetInputSpec, calls AddSpec or SetSpec its InputGenerator
- PrintSignals now says which signal is an input 
- GetInputSignalsIdx returns indices of input signals in the list of signals of a system
- Minor improvement on display status for BreachProblem
- Input specs now are taken into account in Falsification problems
- Breach now stores its model copy and GUI files in a unique folder in Ext/ModelsData
