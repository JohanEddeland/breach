This folder contains examples of systems used with Breach. It is organized as follows:

- Benchs/    contains models used to evaluate Breach performances
- Bio/       contains examples related to systems biology. Those are relatively old work, so might have
             some slightly obsolescence issues.
- ODEs/      contains examples of ODE models 
- Simulink/  contains examples of Simulink models. Your best bet at finding up-to-date and working examples.
- Misc/      contains various models more or less experimental; explore at your own risk.

Note that your best bet at finding up-to-date and working examples is currently by exploring the
Simuling models.
